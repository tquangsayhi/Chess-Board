Chess Game Application - Usage Instructions

Overview:
This is a GUI-based two-player chess game built using C++ and the Qt framework.
The game closely follows the standard rules of chess and includes an intuitive
interface for making moves, viewing game status, and restarting or quitting the game.

The application is intended to help evaluate core game logic, GUI integration,
and basic user interaction.

Game Rules:
- The game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard.
- Each player (White and Black) takes turns to move their pieces.
- The game starts with White's turn.
- Only valid chess moves are allowed.
- A move is made by first selecting a piece and then clicking on one of its valid destinations.
- If a player is in a checkmate state, the game ends and the other player is declared the winner.
- Basic checkmate and win conditions are supported, assuming they are implemented in the Chess logic backend.

Controls and Features:
1. Chessboard Interaction:
   - Click on any of your pieces to see their valid moves.
   - Valid destination squares will be highlighted.
   - Click again on a valid square to move the piece there.

2. Game Information Panel:
   - The right-side panel displays whose turn it is.
   - After each move, the information panel updates automatically.
   - End-of-game messages ("Black won!" or "White won!") are also displayed here.

3. Buttons:
   - Restart: Resets the game to the initial position.
   - Quit: Closes the application window.

4. Graphics:
   - The board alternates between black and white tiles.
   - Each piece is represented with a graphical icon corresponding to its type and color.
   - Highlighted squares show legal moves in red borders.

Instructions to Run:
- Make sure all required Qt resources (like icons in the `:/pieces/` path) are available.
- Compile the project using Qt Creator or a CMake-supported environment.
- Run the executable to launch the GUI.

Limitations:
- No support for en passant, castling, or pawn promotion
